1. Single-threaded version takes: 8 seconds
Multi-threaded version: The main thread took 3 seconds, thread 1 took 2 seconds, and thread 2 took 3 seconds.

2. No because it runs concurrently and so the main thread will be the max of the two threads.

3. The multi-thread would be faster because it runs concurrently and not sequentially unlike the single-thread.

4. There are multiple outputs because one of them could finish before the other. There is no set order.
